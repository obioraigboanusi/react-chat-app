# React Chat App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It allows users to send and receive messages on chat. It utilizes JavaScript BroadcastChannel to share data between different tabs in a brower. It uses redux for state management and the chats are persisted to the localstorage using redux-persist.
